This is an alpha release...

Required Information

1.	Username and password to upload files to the Xoops “classes” 
	directory, aka FTP access.  This information is needed for 
	uploading/installing the smarty v2.6.10 engine and for uploading
	the XoopsGallery2 module.
	
2.	MySQL database name, username and password.  If you have the ability, create
    a new database for the images, just in case you want to delete and start over.
    When installing the gallery2 portion, use a different table prefix than you used
    xoops.  Using a new or the same database as xoops works just as well and fast.
	
3.	Access rights (hopefully with the same FTP access info above) to
	create a directory outside the webserver’s directories.  For 
	example if /var/www/xoops/index.php is accessible by 
	http://www.myxoopsinstall.org/index.php - the xoops directory is 
	the root directory for your webserver so create /var/www/xg2data 
	to store the gallery data. Xg2data would be outside the webserver’s 
	direct reach.  Get it?  You will need to allow the webserver’s “group” 
	write access to this directory. (775 permissions)
	
4.	Administrative rights to the Xoops installation.  
	If you don’t, stop now PLEASE!
	
5.	Any other information I forgot. This is an Alpha 2 release




Quick
This will be a three (3) part installation process.  
The three components to install are the new smarty engine, 
the gallery 2 application, and the XoopsGallery2 module. 
 
I.  SMARTY UPDATE
1.	Update Smarty Engine to v 2.6.10
 a.	  Download xoopsgallery2 alpha file
 b.	  Extract the downloaded file
 c.	  Upload the smarty.xoops.new directory to /class/ (the class
      in the root of the xoops install)
 d.   Turn off your website to outsiders in the admin section
 e.	  Rename the /class/smarty directory to /class/smarty.old
 f.	  Rename /class/smarty.xoops.new to /class/smarty
 g.   Delete the files in the template_c directory
 h.	  Engine update complete.

II. UPLOAD and CREATE PHOTO STORAGE DIRECTORY
2.	Upload the XoopsGallery2 module to a directory name of your choice. (new feature
    initally it is xg2 but you can rename it to anything you like, except pre-existing names, duh)
 a.	  This is done like every other installed module (dont initalize yet)
 b.	  Module in place. Time to initialize components... but...
 
3.	Prior to initializing Gallery2 create a directory for the gallery data.
 a.	  It is highly recommended that the directory be *outside* the website root
 b.	  Directory location example (*nix/*bsd):  
	   i.	/server/html/  <-- server root
	   ii.	/server/xg2data  <-- suggested location for gallery data
	   iii. Can be anywhere you want, really!
 c.	  Make the data storage directory accessible by the web server group
 d.	  Example (*nix/*bsd):  
	   i.	 Web server group is called “apache”
	   ii.	 Your name is “user”
	   iii. chown –R user:apache /server/xg2data
	   iv.	 chmod 774 /server/xg2data/*
 e.	  Gallery2 data directory is setup

III. INSTALL GALLERY 2
4.	Initialize Gallery2.
 a.	  Go to www.yourdomain.com/modules/yourgalleryname/engine/install:  
 b.	  Follow the instructions!
 c.	  You will need to upload an authorization text file to the gallery2 (aka engine) directory
	   i.	/server/path/to/html/modules/yourgalleryname/engine
 d.   You will need to create an empty config.php file in with webserver access
 	   i.   create an empty file in /server/path/to/html/modules/yourgalleryname/engine called config.php
 	   ii.  change permissions to 777 for config.php or at least 666 for write ability.
 d.	  If you are not using the existing Xoops database, you will need to have one ready prior to the Gallery2 initialization
      i. you will need hostname (localhost if on same server), database name, user access name and password.
 e.	  Follow the Gallery2 install instructions, they work!
      i. the files are correct to version 2.0.2 but my computer made the crc checks bad
 f.	  Gallery 2 is installed.

IV. INSTALL XoopsGallery MODULE
5.	Initialize XoopsGallery2 module
 a.	  Like any Xoops module (If you dont know, you aren't ready for this alpha)
      i. go to administration section and initilize the module
      ii. change the prefferences to fit your server settings
      iii. create at least the main menu block.
      iv.  go to the admin menu of the gallery module and click on the Export me link
      v. done.

6.	Go to the XoopsGallery2 module and see if you can admin the gallery.
 a.   I suggest useing the xoops theme, not perfect but works for me.  Also. edit the gallery2 xoops theme to suit your needs.
 b.	  If so then you have the option of changing the /module/yourgalleryname/engine/config.php file to be a embed only install
 c.	  This is recommended after everything works the way you want.
 d.   If something doesnt work correctly, you can login to gallery2 directly (if you didn't follow b above)
 	  i.	http://youweb.com/modules/yourgalleryname/engine

9.	Done. Yea!

Got it?  Good!  Works?
